However, you   could be held liable for losses incurred by KGS or another party due to   someone else using your account or password. You may not use anyone   else's account at any time, without the permission of the account   holder.    We prefer to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date. To   do this, we provide you with the opportunity to update or modify your   PII, including billing and shipping information by logging into your   account.
                                                <br>
                                                When you create or change your account, we will send a message to the   email address confirming the changes made and options you have chosen.   KGS periodically distributes an e-mail newsletter, and you choose   whether you want to receive a newsletter from us when you create your   account. If you later decide not to receive the newsletter, you can   remove yourself from the mailing list at any time.</p>

  <strong>Forgotten, Lost or Stolen Information</strong>: If you have forgotten your   password, we provide a mechanism that e-mails your password to you.   Since the "forgot my password" feature sends your password to the email   address that you used for registration, do not use an email address that   can be accessed by others that you would not want to see or change your   KGS account information.

                                              <h4>What Are the Other Key Elements of KGS's Privacy Policy?</h4>
                                            </div>
                                            
                                            <ul>
                                              <p> <strong>Onward Transfer</strong>: As referenced   above, KGS may transfer or share your PII with an authorized third party   that provides at least the same level of privacy protection as KGS's.   In addition, information about our Customers, including their PII, will   be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a   separate business or the sale or pledge of company assets, as well as in   the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which PII   would be transferred as one of the business assets of KGS.</p>
                                              <p> <strong>Access</strong>: KGS provides Customers   with access to their PII that KGS holds. KGS agrees that Customers may   correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate,   except where the burden or expense of providing access would be   disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy in the case in   question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual   would be violated.
                                              </p>
                                              <p> <strong>Data Integrity</strong>: KGS will collect   PII that is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. KGS   takes reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for its intended   use, accurate, complete, and current. We are also committed to employing   reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our Website.   However, even with the best technology, no website is 100% secure. We   will take reasonable measures which we believe are appropriate to   protect your PII from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, and,   where possible, will ask that any authorized third parties with whom we   may share or transfer such information take comparable steps to protect   that security.</p>
                                              
                                              <p> <strong>Children</strong>: KGS's Website does not   target and is not intended to attract children under the age of 13. We   do not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the   age of 13 or send them requests for Personal Information.</p>
                                              
                                              <p> <strong>Do Not Track Requests</strong>: The   Website does not respond to browser-based, Do Not Track requests or   signals. Further, Company does not allow other parties to collect PII   over time and across different websites when a Customer or user accesses   the Website.</p>
                                            
                                              <p> <strong>Third Party Sites</strong>: KGS's Website   contains links to other sites operated or maintained by third parties.   We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such   website. We will not share your PII with unauthorized third party   websites. Some of these third-party sites may be co-branded with a KGS   logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. Although   KGS chooses its affiliates carefully, KGS is not responsible for the   privacy or security practices of websites operated by third parties. We   encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of third party or   co-branded websites.</p>
